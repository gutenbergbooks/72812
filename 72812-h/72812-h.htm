</div>

<p>Everyone has heard of Port Sunlight, but it is doubtful whether
many have formed a definite or just estimate of this unique example
of industrial housing. The following pages are an attempt to record
its best features and to show how far the ideal which inspired it has
succeeded. To those who have not seen it Port Sunlight is perhaps
regarded as one of many other similar places. It is in reality something
very different from all others, and especially does it stand by
itself in the motive which founded it, which has carried it out, and
which continues to administrate it. The breadth of vision which
has made Port Sunlight possible is perhaps a greater matter than the
village itself. This must inevitably have its effect, but the author
ventures to predict that the artistic aspect of the place, which receives
some permanent record herein, may also obtain full recognition and
emulation as time goes on.</p>

<p>Those who look for finality in any human accomplishment are
doomed to disappointment, but the measure of our success will
surely be in proportion to the quality of our aims. The last and
best word we can say about the village of Port Sunlight is that the
aim of its founder has been based on the belief that sympathy for
the wants and well-being of our fellow-men may find a large expression
even in our business dealings.</p>

<p>It is very delightful to contemplate the results of an undertaking
like Port Sunlight—a beneficent enterprise which no law could force
from any public body or private employer, and which no mere
compiler of accounts for capital and interest would dare to sanction.
The ideal which prompted it is the real thing that matters, and
though it may be maintained that the carrying out of it pays—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</span>
pays well—we may still hold fast to the hope that both those who
make such villages and those who live in them will ever cherish some
beliefs which are above and beyond all that which is concerned with
a mere monetary return. How fortunate the workpeople who are
enabled to live under such ideal conditions!</p>

<p>This little book is entirely due to the desire of the author himself
to illustrate the results of an enterprise which he has closely
followed from its inception. The combination of the practical and
the artistic has been achieved in Port Sunlight with outstanding
success, and in these pages it is believed that this is fairly shown,
though the building record is not yet by any means complete.</p>

<p>It would be the merest affectation to leave out of these pages any
mention of the founder, Sir William Hesketh Lever, Bart., one of the
leaders of industrial enterprise in this country. Amongst the many
things he has done for the benefit of his fellow-countrymen there is
surely nothing we have more to thank him for than the homes which
are the subject of this book. To provide employment for thousands
and then to give them such homes to live in must be a good reward
for a life’s work to the man with an ideal.</p>

<p>My thanks are due to Mr. Herbert Batsford, the head of his
firm, who has not only superintended every detail connected with
the production but has added personal interest and advice due to
his special sympathy with the subject. To Mr. Alex. Paul, of the
Editorial and Social Department, Port Sunlight, I am indebted for
much kind help.</p>

<p>The photographic views are largely from the studio of
Mr. Geo. W. Davies, New Ferry.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Ideal"><em>The Ideal.</em></h2>

<p>The individual or community which has no ideal is to be pitied.
For, whatever may happen, there is always a better chance for those
who maintain a high ideal than for those who, without one, adventure
themselves against the chances and difficulties that surround us.
Nothing is more disheartening to the idealist and reformer than to
find not only thousands of individuals but whole communities
without a guiding star of faith and hope.</p>

<p>How fortunate is a place like Port Sunlight, when we compare
its history and possibilities with those of London! It is pleasant to
realise that what has become a problem of such a very serious kind
in London after so many years of haphazard and chance, is happily
barred out of the horizon in the definitely schemed plan of the
garden city or the model village. But it is one thing to have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
scheme or an ideal and another to have a good one. Moreover, as
to whether it is good or bad, or wholly or only partially good or
bad, the scheme does not always show until it has been some time in
operation. In time the awkward corners may be rounded off, or
they may become more acute, but the actual life of the community
in any so-called model village or town soon proves the value or
the unimportance of those features which have been part of the
design.</p>

<p>What most impresses itself on those who study the industrial
village of Port Sunlight is the fact that it is the definite outcome
of a genuine ideal. Whether its present state has surpassed
the hopes of its founder or has failed to realise them, we can at
any rate see that this was meant to be something better than
what had been before, and that no effort was to be wanting
to secure this. We are sure that the inconsequent charm and
the haphazard picturesqueness of an old English village were
not the main objects in view, but that the aim was a conveniently
planned and healthy settlement laid out with all possible artistic
thought on sound business lines. Garden grounds, roads, and
open spaces were to be ample without being wasteful, houses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
were to be picturesque but sensibly planned. Avenues were
to be planted and gardens laid out with needful limitations as
to size and direction. The
individuality of separate
gardens was to be subordinated
to a definite idea
of communal amenity.
Variety of plan was to be
obtained only within a
certain economic range.</p>
<br>

<p>It is surely often realised
that many of our beautiful
gardens could not have
been laid out in a complete
and detailed scheme from
the beginning, but that a
good deal of their success
has been evolved from a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
gradual development of possibilities. So also whilst the picturesque
charm of an old town or village may result from the
chances and changes of many years, we cannot expect that fully
developed schemes for new settlements can attain perfection at
the outset. The constant maintenance of an ideal in the life of
a town or village is, therefore, of the greatest import, and no
niggardly spirit should stand
in the way of changes for
which time alone may prove
the need.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Foundation"><em>The Foundation.</em></h2>

<p>The life of a village or town must be created of enduring
materials and based on some sort of sound business principles. It is
the very essence of the village of Port Sunlight that it is claimed
to be a sound business enterprise. Though much more than half
a million pounds of capital spent on land and buildings has been
left out of count for interest, it is still maintained that all outlays
have in the main been justified by sound business principles. That
the well-being and comfort of their workpeople is a valuable business
asset is no new belief with employers of labour. The belief has
been acted upon for many years past, but its application has made
rapid strides in more recent times. It is probable, however, that
there is not another place where this belief has been so very completely
demonstrated as at Port Sunlight. The inhabitants of this
fortunate village appear to have been saved every needless risk, and
have even escaped the snare of mere profit-sharing, in favour of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
prosperity-sharing and copartnership. It will be of interest here to
quote from a Paper by the founder, Sir W. H. Lever, on prosperity-sharing,
in November, 1900. “The truest and highest form of
enlightened self-interest requires that we pay the fullest regard to
the interest and welfare of those around us, whose well-being we
must bind up with our own, and with whom we must share our
prosperity. We cannot live in comfort with others if we do not
share our comforts with them. If we wish men to be honest
towards ourselves, we must be honest with them. If we wish men
to help us to achieve prosperity, they must feel assured that we will
share that prosperity with them. If capital and management think
of nothing but their own narrowest, selfish self-interest, without
a thought for labour, care nothing for the comfort or welfare of
labour, care nothing whether labour is well or ill-housed, whether
labour is provided with opportunity for reasonable and proper
recreation and relief from toil or not, then capital and management
are blind to their own highest interest.... Also the converse of the
above is equally true.... If labour adopts the spirit of enlightened
and intelligent self-interest, and if capital and management do the
same, if each recognise the principle that by looking after the
interests of the other they are taking the surest means to achieve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
their own self-interest,
business
will be healthier,
happiness in business
will be greater,
the prosperity of
the business of the
whole country will
be assured, and the
bogey of foreign
competition will be
laid once and for all.
I venture to submit
that prosperity-sharing
on the basis
of enlightened self-interest
will secure
this.”</p>

<p>It is only by comparing the conditions at Port Sunlight with
those of other residential areas that the full measure of their value
can be ascertained. In some respects the outsider is perhaps a better
judge of the success of such a village than are the residents, who
come to take a good deal for granted. Thus the visitor who now
for the first time goes to Port Sunlight and realises the extent and
quality of the work done is naturally much impressed by the variety
and interest which the whole village affords, whilst those who are in
constant residence may not realise it so keenly. It is hardly possible
that those who live in the many charming cottages which have
sprung up in this country in recent years, or who have lived a long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
time in some of the
best of our old
English cottages,
can take that
delight in their
appearance which
the detached
observer feels. It
is quite possible
that wide staring
panes of glass and
sash windows and
treeless streets have
as many admirers
amongst the average
public as are
found for the
quaint latticed windows
and leafy
avenues of Port
Sunlight. But the
air of detachment which inevitably goes with the outside observer
of new places is an element of some moment in arriving at an
estimate of results. It is obvious that the estimation of a place
like this may be based upon practical issues chiefly, or from the
purely artistic standpoint, or again, from a point of view which
includes both. The main concern of this book is to emphasise
the artistic and picturesque qualities of the village whilst not
overlooking the fact that artistic values should not be obtained
by the sacrifice of practical needs. This could be the only
possible point of view which would give final satisfaction to the
business man. It is maintained that no undertaking in the world
which has been based on purely artistic desires and which has
had no basis of practical value has been of any lasting value.
The whole foundation of Port Sunlight is believed to consist of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
practical values and
sound business
principles.</p>

<p>One thing which
is at once obvious
from the general
scheme is the adoption
of open spaces,
communal gardens,
and allotments in preference to the
spaces which are devoted to individual
gardens surrounding each
cottage in so many other places.
There is something to be said for
and against this. The general
amenity of the village gains by the
Port Sunlight method, whilst the
special charm of individual gardens
which enthusiastic efforts produce
is naturally lacking. In this way
we get less value of contrasts, and
lose something of that spirit of
emulation which spurs the individual
to special effort. Of one
thing, however, there can be no
doubt. The absence of the many
dividing lines of fences between
each cottage frontage produces a
breadth of effect along the lines of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
roadways which is in itself very pleasing. From the point of view
of the town-planner who looks for the collective result this is, of
course, very satisfactory.</p>
<br>

<p class="no-indent fs80">W. OWEN, Architect.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Another thing which will be noticed in the illustrations is the
elevation of many of the houses above the level of the roadway.
This gives a much wider and pleasanter outlook from the windows
of the cottages, besides producing a much better effect in the buildings
from the roadway than when they are placed on the same level.
The sloping green banks leading up to terraced paths in front of
the cottages are a distinctive feature of the village. (See Pl. <a href="#i_p041">4</a>.)</p>

<p>It has been maintained that without a good deal of monotony
you cannot get very fine architectural results, and it must be admitted
that many examples go to prove it. There is a large surface of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
monotony in the
Pyramids; there is
a marvellous monotony
of detail in the
Houses of Parliament;
there is a
boundless monotony
in the house fronts
in Gower Street, yet
all these have been
admired. So this
line of argument
might have suggested
the continued
employment of only
one architect, or at least only one type of design, for the cottages
at Port Sunlight. The great variety of designs in the cottages,
which has proved one of the attractions of the place, has, however,
in some sense at least, justified itself. Even the flamboyant Gothic
dormers and the stepped Belgian gables have a reacting influence on
some of their neighbours, though we might consider the latter rather
unpractical on the one hand, or the former too pretentious on the
other. Moreover, whilst we wonder at the generosity of view which
could bestow some of these solid oak-framed structures with their
wealth of carving and enriched plaster panellings on the working
classes of an industrial village, we cannot but feel grateful to the
hand that gave them, though we ourselves may never be able to
afford such luxuries of the building art for ourselves. May we not
accept these as symbols of some kindly gratitude with which a profitable
company decorates the homes of its industrial population?
Honestly, we cannot regret these <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonnes bouches</i> in the building
scheme, though they bravely put out of sight the counting-house
and the rates of interest! These are really very welcome ebullitions
from that solid undercurrent of practical economy which has placed
the whole concern on a sound business footing.</p>

<p>This element of variety which is so marked in the design of the
cottages at Port Sunlight has been obtained without much departure
from the genuine English type. Even where a Dutch or Belgian
character appears it is carried out with something of the breadth
and simplicity which one associates with purely English work.
There is very little, if anything, that could be called freakish or odd.
The stepped gables or the flamboyant dormers which vary the treatment
are not unacceptable as variants. As to the use of oak framing
with plaster panels—the familiar Old English style—no one can
deny its charm or fail to wish there were even more of it. Nothing
is so picturesque and nothing so cheerful of aspect as the black and
white work which forms so frequent a feature in the earlier buildings
erected. One only regrets that it is difficult to justify it from a
strictly commercial point of view, especially if it is executed in a
sound and substantial manner. Whether the half-timber work is
used for the whole building, or only partially in connection with the
fine red sandstone of the district, or with bricks or flint-work, it has
an undeniable and enduring charm, and we owe much of our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>pleasure in the whole appearance of Port Sunlight to the liberal
views of the founder, who did not permit his vision of a beautiful
village to be obscured by the clouds of philistinism! You
cannot, of course, pretend that such gables as those shown in our
illustrations are necessary to cottage building. Nor is it surely
possible for even a Port Sunlight to be entirely built in such a way;
but the pleasure produced by such character of work is, after all,
common property, and is a valuable item in regard to the whole
scheme.</p>

<h2><em>The Plan.</em></h2>

<p>The general plan of Port Sunlight shows now an inhabited area
nearly a mile long by nearly half that wide, bounded on the longer
sides by the new Chester Road (on the east) and the main railway
lines to London, and Greendale Road (on the west). (See No. <a href="#i_p036">39</a>.)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
There is enough variety of level to avoid the monotony of an entirely
flat area, and one piece of natural dell, well grown over with trees and
shrubs, forms a delightful feature near the Works end of the village.
Goods from the Works are loaded, on the one side, into railway
wagons, and on the other into barges on the Bromborough Pool, from
which they emerge into the River Mersey. From this pool there
used to be gutters or ravines, up which the muddy tidal water
flowed right up into where the village now stands, but these have
all been cut off from the tide and, with the exception of the dell
above referred to, filled up.</p>
<br>

<p>One very notable innovation on the common practice of estate
development is the fronting of houses towards the railway instead
of the long lines of unlovely backs which usually exhibit all their
unhappy privacies to the railway passengers. Though one long
thoroughfare—the Greendale Road—runs alongside the railway
embankment for the greater part of a mile, one cannot feel it to be
other than one of the pleasantest roads on the estate. One of the
illustrations indicates the excellent result here obtained.</p>

<p>Every intelligent student of town-planning knows that you
cannot rule out a number of rectangular plots arranged on axial lines
without due consideration of varying levels and a proper expression
of local features. Moreover, the planning of many right-angled
plots is not in itself a very desirable aim. But at Port Sunlight
it was possible to create some rectangular spaces with the Art
Gallery and the Church on their axial lines in such a way as to make
a striking and orderly scheme as a central feature in the estate.
There are numbers of winding or diagonal roads which give variety
and interest and afford pleasant lines of perspective to the groups
of houses.</p>

<p>In an especial way one might claim that the best results in the
planning of a new village will be obtained through bearing in mind
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>the classical saying, “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ars est celare artem</i>.” In such a scheme
we do not wish to be confronted with buildings of ponderous
dignity or a big display of formal lines and <em>places</em>. Anything
approaching ostentation or display is surely out of place, and what
we want is something expressing the simplicity and unobtrusiveness
which is the tradition handed down to us through the charm of the
old English village. This is best attained by variety in direction of
roads and shapes of houses by forming unexpected corners, recessed
spaces, and winding vistas.</p>

<p>Port Sunlight village (founded in 1888), apart from the Works,
covers 222 acres, on which the houses may approach 2,000 for a
population of 10,000. The tenancies of the houses are limited
to employés of the Works. Already over 1,000 houses have been
built or are in process of building, and the length of broad roadways
exceeds five miles. The first block of cottages built in 1888-1889<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
was reproduced at the Brussels Exhibition of 1910, and was
awarded the Grand Prix. It is intended to limit the number of
cottages to ten per acre, and it is hoped to keep below that
maximum.</p>

<p>The general width of the roadways is 40 feet, giving 24 feet to
the road, and 8 feet for each footpath; but there are roads 48 feet
wide, including footpaths. The paths are flagged along the central
portion only.</p>

<p>In a progressive world, and especially in such a progressive part
of it as Port Sunlight, one cannot hope to give a record which will
for long represent existing facts. The arrangements which have
been made for the benefit of the inhabitants of this village have
necessarily been altered or modified. At the present time the
buildings for general use include Christ Church (No. <a href="#i_p004-2">6</a> and Pls.
<a href="#i_p095">31-33</a>), an admirable Late Gothic building in a central position,
the Schools, which accommodate about 1,600 children, a Lyceum, a

<p>Port Sunlight has
been an object of
attraction to visitors
for years, and this
is not only due to
the interest and
variety of its cottage
houses, and as a
model for town
planners the world
over, but to the
whole-hearted endeavour
to meet all
the practical and
social needs of everyday
life which is
expressed in its
various public buildings.
But another
source of great and
enduring attraction
lies in its Art
Gallery. Here it outdistances every other village of the kind, for
this Art Gallery holds no fortuitous collection of odd things, but
carefully chosen examples of fine art got together by expert<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
knowledge.
The pictures,
china, furniture,
etc.,
would alone
bring many
visitors to study
such a superb
and finely-housed
collection
of works
of art.</p>

<p>We are apt
to forget that
a newly created village or town does not reap all its benefits at
once. Not only as regards the results of growth in trees and
shrubs, the development of gardens, and the mellowing influences
of time and tone, but also in relation to all the amenities of social
life, we must wait for those influences which can only come in a
gradual process. The subject of trees alone, of the best method
to deal with living growth, is not finished with for some time, if
ever. Some of the avenues at Port Sunlight are charming now,
and show an admirable balance of effect between trees and buildings.
Down the avenue of poplars one of our sketches (Pl. <a href="#i_p039">3</a>)
shows how delightfully the Club and the Library peep out, and
how well the vista leads up to the Post Office beyond—so in some
of the winding roads the effect even in summer is just right. But
trees keep growing, and unless the houses are to suffer they will
have to be cut down and some removed entirely. Then, again, the
Diamond (Pl. <a href="#i_p037">2</a>) (which in spite of its name is a great oblong
open space), bordered by groups of cottages and bounded at one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
end by the new Art Gallery, will very well bear all the height the
trees will ever reach. This is a very fine open space, and borders
of big trees will help, and never belittle it. Possibly the secret of
successful planting amongst cottage houses is to have plenty of
slow-growing evergreens, and forest trees only at intervals. It is
quite certain that if the garden spaces at Port Sunlight were
punctuated with decoratively placed evergreens, and inclosed by
living borders of box or yew, the result would be both pleasing
and long-lasting. The open spaces now secured should make for
ever pleasant oases amongst the long lines of houses, and even if
all the tree avenues had to go, there would still be left much to
excite the envy of those who have to live in our dirty old towns.</p>

<p>One of our sketches shows the avenue which leads to Christ
Church from Greendale Road (Pl. <a href="#i_p059">13</a>). It is obvious that the
sturdy breadth and dignity of the church will never lose anything,
however lofty the avenue becomes. Unfortunately we cannot
afford the space in the thoroughfares for the trees so that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
will not be a trouble to the buildings some day. The only
possible way would be to plant them down the centre of the
roads, so keeping the traffic in the two opposite directions in its
right place. This is a counsel of perfection, but it has been done
where wide road spaces were practicable.</p>

<p>An evidence of the careful economic spirit which has guided
the whole enterprise may be found in the plans of the buildings at
Port Sunlight. There are here no freaks or features created
simply for picturesque effect, nor any serious attempt to give the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
occupants something
they do not want.
It will probably be a
long time before any
great reform in cottage
planning can be
maintained in face of
the varying views of
the tenants. Thus
the rooms must be
big enough, but they
must not be so large
as to cause needless
work. The better
class cottages <em>must</em>
have parlours, and
only those who cannot
afford them will
go without. Plaster
walls seem to be
almost always preferred
to those lined
with boarding, white-washed
bricks, or any
other healthy or
artistic departure
from the modern
British type. Thus we find that the compact and economic plans
in the village are what give the most universal satisfaction. But
in the scheme of the planning the juxtaposition of the cottages
has been dealt with in a free and varied manner, so that we find
rows of houses, or <b>L</b>-shaped blocks, or semi-quads, or curved
frontages, or semi-splayed quads. A census of opinion would
probably be all in favour of straight rows, and have been dead
against the judicious variety which gives so much interest to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
the place. Theoretically, one would perhaps like those who
live in cottages to give up the fetish of the parlour and have
one really ample living-room instead. But the inherent yearning
for privacy is an English characteristic which closes the door
of domestic affairs from the casual visitor. Moreover, the sin
of affectation creeps into all our buildings, and thus the cottage
apes the little villa, the little villa apes the large one, the large one
apes the mansion, and the mansion apes the palace.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp55" id="i_p027" style="max-width: 43.5em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">32. A GARDEN CORNER.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The cottage reformer would of course say that the cottage
tenant would be far happier and healthier as a rule without a
parlour, for then he
would have a fine
living-room which
might be free of all
incumbrances and
free of draughts.
But it has to be
taken for granted
that most who can
afford parlours
prefer to have
them; therefore the
plans are of two
types, the kitchen
cottage and the
parlour cottage.
Our illustrations
show how these are
planned, and it is
not of little interest
to see how varied
may be the exterior
treatment as developed
from these
plans.</p>
<br>

<p>Some of the plans which have been found successful we give
illustrations of. These (Nos. <a href="#i_p027">33-35</a>) are carefully schemed. There
is a bath in each and three bedrooms, each with a fireplace. The
W.C.’s are entered from outside. The parlour cottage plan is
also given. It shows what a fine living-room might be obtained in
a scheme which eliminated the parlour. It is obvious that the
question of cost is more or less elusive. The original cost of the
smaller cottages was £200, and of the parlour cottages £330 to
£350, but this has risen now to £330 for cottages and £550 for
parlour houses. At the present time the gross rentals of the
kitchen cottages average now 6<em>s.</em> 3<em>d.</em> each, whilst for the parlour
cottages the rent would be 7<em>s.</em> 6<em>d.</em>, excluding rates and taxes.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In any estimate of the value of Port Sunlight as a housing
scheme it must always be remembered, as Mr. W. L. George has
pointed out, that it is an experiment rather in <em>ideal</em> than in <em>cheap</em><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
housing. This question of ideal was the first point referred to in
this record. That it has been largely realised and entirely justified
is something for which its founder must feel profoundly glad.
All sorts of economies and precautions might have been adopted
which have been boldly and generously set aside. The ideal was
always kept in view, and if it ever disappears it will be only after the
disappearance of the original founder himself! It is a pleasant
task to gather together in this little book the evidence of belief
that a more real partnership between capitalist and workpeople
would work a lasting good. That good is not to be measured in a
notation of gold, nor even amongst those who live and thrive
under the immediate benefits of Port Sunlight. Its influence goes
round the world
like the beneficent
rays which are symbolised
in its own
expressive title.</p>

<p>Many of those
who scan these
pages will never see
Port Sunlight itself,
and so will not
realise how much
better is the reality
than the printed
page. In judging
the results it must
never be forgotten
that the saving
grace of common
sense has been a
constant guide in
its ultimate development
and expression.
No one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>could pretend that
these thousand cottages
form the finest
possible aggregate of
architectural skill in
individual design or
co-ordinated effect.
Here and there one
finds perhaps an
exaggeration of simplicity
on the one
hand or of richness
on the other; in
some cases the
restraint may be a little obvious or the picturesqueness a little
overstrained, but the balance of effect is that of a well-ordered
and varied interest. To realise the value of Port Sunlight as an
industrial village one has only to compare it with other enterprises.
The architect can read clearly enough from it many lessons in
design, a few of what to avoid perhaps, but many that he may
emulate. The social reformer sees an object lesson in the value
of a pleasant and well-planned community of houses in which
individuality is left ample freedom of expression. The projector
of industrial enterprise realises the mutual benefits of good and
attractive housing. Little, if anything, in this country can be compared
to it in its general measure of success. This success should
act as a stimulus to an ever-widening effort to make the improved
conditions of daily life one of the definite aims of industrial
enterprise generally.</p>

<p>The full-page Plates <a href="#i_p039">3</a> to <a href="#i_p087">27</a> give an idea of the road views
and the relation of the houses to them, with their perspective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
effects in straight or winding lines of frontage, with quadrangular
recesses as in Pls. <a href="#i_p055">11</a> and <a href="#i_p073">20</a>, or where the <b>L</b>-shaped blocks of
cottages leave a good open space as in Pl. <a href="#i_p051">9</a>. The sturdy tower
of Christ Church is a telling feature at the end of the Causeway (see
Pl. <a href="#i_p059">13</a>), and the picturesque pavilion roof with its clever tiling
makes a telling feature at the junction of the Causeway with Greendale
Road. It is hard to imagine anything more delightful in the
early spring or autumn than the Greendale Road where it approaches
the post office, with the peeps of the buildings through the tall
poplars. The view towards the post office in both directions
(Pls. <a href="#i_p039">3</a> and <a href="#i_p047">7</a>) are
equally pleasing. Nothing
shows better the
good qualities of an
Old English half-timber
building than
such a setting. There
is hardly anything in
the village which comes
back on one with such
recurring charm as the
row of five gables in
the Park Road cottages
shown in Pls. <a href="#i_p043">5</a> and <a href="#i_p061">14</a>. In Pl. <a href="#i_p043">5</a> we see something of the
delightful result of the continuous sloping banks from the
road up to the cottage, and a certain picturesque irregularity
where the old hawthorn bushes which formerly existed have been
left at intervals. This vertical timber framing has a simple
breadth of effect which is well shown in Pls. <a href="#i_p041">4</a>, <a href="#i_p043">5</a>, and <a href="#i_p061">14</a>. It
would be difficult to do justice to Greendale Road with its continuous
line of 97 cottages, which form a picture of great variety
and interest as viewed from the passing trains, and give us a long
perspective of trees and houses, broken at the point of view of
our sketch (Pl. <a href="#i_p063">15</a>) by the half-timber group of cottages which is
an exact replica of the design of Kenyon Old Hall. This delightful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
group is also shown in Pl. <a href="#i_p073">20</a>. There is nothing more satisfactory
in proportion and colour than the recessed group of cottages
which fronts the Diamond in the Queen Mary’s Drive. The yellow-grey
stone slates, the red brick chimneys, the white rough cast, dark
boarding, and robust half-timber work in the flanking gables, make
up a picture of colour and texture which is most satisfactory (Pl. <a href="#i_p037">2</a>).
The cottages here have the advantage of a raised terrace bounded
by a stone wall. One of the nearest approaches to the charm of an
old English village is probably the L-shaped group of cottages in
Bath Street (see Pl. <a href="#i_p007">9</a>). A photograph of the Dell has been taken
to show one of the natural features which has been turned to so
good an account in the village (see Pl. <a href="#i_p008">10</a>). The cottages looking
over the roadways surrounding the Dell have delightful outlooks
over here. Our view was taken in the winter, so as to show something
of the bridge and houses. The stone bridge at the end of the
Dell is an excellent architectural feature (see Nos. <a href="#i_p001">1</a> and <a href="#i_p002">2</a>), and
groups with remarkably good result below the Lyceum buildings.</p>

<p>No illustrative account of Port Sunlight could be considered
complete without some reference to Christ Church, which is a central
and interesting feature. Its solidly built red stone walls and stone
slated roof, and its finely appointed interior with a wealth of enriched
oak timber work, commands one’s attention whether as architect or
layman. It speaks of strength and endurance and a sincere love and
study of our traditional English Gothic. Its value is sufficiently
apparent both from the social and the artistic point of view. In one
respect, however, this church may claim a special distinction, for at
its western end has been erected a richly detailed narthex, with a
vaulted roof, forming a shrine for a beautiful sculptured memorial
to the late Lady Lever. Both in idea and execution, this forms a
striking and touching memorial to a gracious lady whose kindliness
of heart endeared her to all. Children were her special friends, and
this is reflected in the two charming figures of children at one end
of the sarcophagus. Sir Goscombe John, the sculptor, has never
been more successful than in this tenderly and gracefully modelled
reclining figure of Lady Lever. This vaulted porch, with its richly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
carved bosses (on one of which are painted the arms of Sir William),
largely enhances the value of the memorial sarcophagus itself, which
is one of the most satisfactory of recent years. The illustration of
the interior (see Pl. <a href="#i_p099">33</a>) is from a large drawing exhibited by the
architect at the Royal Academy in 1916.</p>

<p>Our illustrations, in a general way, represent what may be taken
to be the best examples of design in the village. They do not, of
course, show all the best. In Pl. <a href="#i_p089">28</a> we have a very good example
of the quality of detail which lifts the work at Port Sunlight so far
above the level of the ordinary speculative cottage building. Here
we find carved oak beams and posts and brackets and barges, and an
excellent piece of modelled plaster work in the gable. When it is
remembered that this is no isolated example, we see how unusually
liberal has been the hand that directed the outlay. Corners like the
picturesque grouping of chimneys in No. <a href="#i_p023">28</a>, or the carved oak and
modelled plaster in the corner gable (No. <a href="#i_p007">9</a>), would not have
existed in an industrial village had not the founder been imbued
with a keen appreciation of architectural values. One would present
a sketch proposal for such a type of cottages with some trepidation
to the average building owner! One of the noticeable bits of rich
detail is to be found in the Flamboyant and Gothic dormers in Pl.
<a href="#i_p087">27</a>. We have in No. <a href="#i_p027">32</a> a delightful corner of half-timber building
with a sweet little garden foreground. The old Cheshire type of
half-timber work is tellingly expressed in the corner houses in Park
Road (Pl. <a href="#i_p065">16</a>). Other especially effective corners are seen in Nos.
<a href="#i_p009">11</a> and <a href="#i_p022">27</a>. A contrast between Queen Anne brick gables and the
half-timber house is effectively shown in No. <a href="#i_p016">21</a>. Contrasting again
with the richness of carved oak and modelled plaster in the more
elaborate buildings, we come across delightfully simple designs, such
as Nos. <a href="#i_p012">15</a> and <a href="#i_p014-1">17</a>, which may some day very well pass for ancient
buildings.</p>

<p>Amongst the conspicuously successful of recent groups is that of
the parlour houses in Bolton Road (Pl. <a href="#i_p075">21</a>), which has the advantage
of a good setting on the front of a circular <em>place</em>. This only
needs a terrace wall and some formal planting to make it one of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
pictures of the village. What an enticing prospect opens up in the
possibilities of formal evergreen planting amongst all these cottage
homes!</p>

<p>It is with some feeling of regret that more sketches have not
been given showing examples of interesting ornamental detail
which lift the quality of these cottage homes so much above the
ordinary level of industrial homes. But the limits of the volume
place an inevitable check on one’s desires. If the author has been
able to convey to his readers a tithe of the pleasure he has felt in
the subject of this little book he will be amply rewarded.</p>

<p>Enough has perhaps been said in appreciation of some points
which mark out the qualities of Port Sunlight. Much more might
be written, but for the rest we leave the illustrations to tell their
own tale. We have shown nothing of the great auditorium which
seats 3,000 people, or of the detailed appointments of the new Art
Gallery, but we have a sketch of the splendid open air swimming
pool and our birds-eye view of the Diamond gives some notion of
the pleasant grouping of the homes amongst pleasant open spaces
and tree-lined avenues. A great deal of what we do not show is left
in reserve for those who can find opportunity to go and see for themselves
what this wonderful scheme of industrial housing can teach.</p>
